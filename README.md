A local __web-based__ application made with __Tauri v2__ + __Vue__ (JavaScript).\
The application's goal is to have a list of your own game and play it.

## Installation & Launch

[__Download__](https://github.com/KaanSacma/CGLauncher/releases/tag/Latest) the lastest release and Install it.\
To __launch__ the application please start as __admin__ unless it will not save your game list! (It's a __web-based__ app that's why)

## Future Plan

I am planning to make the application looks better.\
Here is some functionalities that I can add:
- Adding __game icon/image__ with an api.
- Adding __tags__.
- Adding an advanced __search bar__.
- Adding a __change__ of list order.
- __. . .__
